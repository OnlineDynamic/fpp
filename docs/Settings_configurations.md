# Settings Definitions Explained

## Setting defs, storage and initialisation

FPP settings are defined in www/settings.json and for some default values are define in this file

The config setup is done by config.php which uses a mixture of logic, already saved settings and default values to create a php 'settings' array variable.

The local instance of fpp stores its current setting configuration in:  /home/fpp/media/settings
